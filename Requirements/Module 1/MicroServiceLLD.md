# Microservice Architecture for Module 1: Administrative Request Management

## Microservices

### User Management Service
- **Responsibilities:** Handles user authentication, authorization, and profile management.
- **Endpoints:** 
  - `POST /login`
  - `POST /register`
  - `PUT /profile`
  - `GET /user/{id}`

### Document Management Service
- **Responsibilities:** Manages the digitalization, storage, and retrieval of administrative documents.
- **Endpoints:** 
  - `POST /documents`
  - `GET /documents/{id}`
  - `GET /documents`
  - `DELETE /documents/{id}`

### Request Processing Service
- **Responsibilities:** Manages the creation, tracking, and approval of various administrative requests.
- **Endpoints:** 
  - `POST /requests`
  - `PUT /requests/{id}`
  - `GET /requests/{id}/status`
  - `GET /requests`

### Notification Service
- **Responsibilities:** Sends notifications to users and relevant stakeholders about request statuses and approvals.
- **Endpoints:** 
  - `POST /notifications`
  - `GET /notifications`
  - `PUT /notifications/preferences`

### Approval Workflow Service
- **Responsibilities:** Manages the approval workflows for different types of requests.
- **Endpoints:** 
  - `POST /workflows`
  - `PUT /workflows/{id}/approve`
  - `PUT /workflows/{id}/reject`
  - `GET /workflows/{id}/status`

### Reporting and Analytics Service
- **Responsibilities:** Provides reporting and analytics on administrative requests and document management.

- **Endpoints:** 
  - `GET /audit-logs`
  - `POST /compliance-checks`
  - `GET /security-alerts`

## Communication and Integration

- **API Gateway:** Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.
- **Service Registry and Discovery:** Keeps track of all available microservices and their instances, enabling dynamic discovery and load balancing.
- **Message Broker:** Facilitates asynchronous communication between microservices, ensuring reliable message delivery and decoupling services.
- **Database per Service:** Each microservice has its own database, ensuring data encapsulation and independence.

## Deployment and Scaling

- **Containerization:** Use Docker to containerize each microservice, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Orchestration:** Use Kubernetes to manage container deployment, scaling, and networking.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement centralized monitoring and logging using tools like Prometheus and ELK Stack to track the health and performance of microservices.
