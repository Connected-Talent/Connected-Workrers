### Implementation Considerations

---

#### **Data Partitioning**

- **Per Microservice Database:**

  - Each microservice, including the **Training Service**, manages its own data store.
  - Ensures service autonomy and scalability.

- **Partitioning Strategy:**
  - Logical partitions based on:
    - Departments
    - Training programs
  - Supports efficient querying and compliance with organizational data handling policies.

---

#### **Compliance with Regulations**

- **Hybrid Workflows:**

  - Supports both digital and physical processes for flexibility.
  - Example: Training certifications requiring physical documentation are accommodated.

- **Digital Signatures:**
  - Applied to documents where legally acceptable.
  - Physical signatures retained for processes like salary domiciliation.

---

#### **SLA Management**

- **Monitoring and Enforcement:**

  - SLA definitions embedded in workflows managed by the **Workflow Service**.
  - Automated monitoring ensures compliance.

- **Escalation Mechanisms:**
  - Notifications sent to higher management when SLAs are breached.
  - Includes workflows to escalate approvals or actions.

---

#### **Handling Hybrid Workflows**

- **Digital Processes:**

  - Includes online tests, digital certifications, and automated notifications.

- **Physical Processes:**
  - Handles printing of documents requiring physical signatures.
  - Tracks the status of physical documents in transit or processing.

---

#### **CQRS and Materialized Views**

- **CQRS Implementation:**

  - Separates read and write models for better performance and scalability.
  - Write models for real-time updates; read models for efficient query operations.

- **Materialized Views:**
  - Managed by the **Analytics Service** for:
    - Training progress tracking
    - Operator certification data
    - SLA compliance dashboards

---

#### **Workflow Automation with Azure Durable Functions**

- **Training Workflows:**

  - Orchestrates training processes, including:
    - Scheduling
    - Test assignment
    - Result collection

- **SLA Breaches and Escalations:**
  - Monitors training deadlines.
  - Automates notifications and escalates overdue tasks.

---

#### **Core Principles**

- **Autonomy:**

  - Each microservice operates independently, managing its own data and business logic.
  - Example: **Training Service** handles all training-related operations without external dependencies.

- **Loose Coupling:**

  - Services interact through asynchronous event-driven communication.
  - Minimizes interdependencies, ensuring resilience and fault isolation.

- **Scalability:**

  - Independent scaling for microservices to handle demand surges.
  - Example: **Training Service** can scale during peak training seasons.

- **Compliance:**
  - Hybrid workflows ensure adherence to legal and organizational policies.
  - Supports necessary documentation processes to remain compliant.
